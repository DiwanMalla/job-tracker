# Job Tracker App Idea

## Overview
A full-stack job tracker application built with Next.js to help users manage and track their job applications as they prepare to graduate. The app follows SOLID and DRY principles for maintainable, scalable code.

## Features
- **Application Tracking:** Add, view, and update job applications (company, position, date, status).
- **Resume & Cover Letter Upload:** Attach the specific resume and cover letter used for each application.
- **Notes & Reminders:** Add notes and set follow-up reminders for each application.
- **Dashboard:** Filter and sort applications by status, company, or date.
- **Authentication:** Secure user login and data privacy.
- **Document Management:** Upload and manage multiple resumes and cover letters.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite
- **File Storage:** Local or cloud (e.g., AWS S3)
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js or similar
- **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS or Material UI

## SOLID & DRY Principles
- **SOLID:**
  - Single Responsibility: Each component and API route has one clear purpose.
  - Open/Closed: Components and logic are extendable without modifying existing code.
  - Liskov Substitution: Reusable, interchangeable components.
  - Interface Segregation: Separate interfaces for different features (e.g., file upload, application tracking).
  - Dependency Inversion: Use abstractions for database and storage.
- **DRY:**
  - Shared utility functions for common logic.
  - Reusable UI components.
  - Centralized validation and error handling.

## Example User Flow
1. Sign up and log in.
2. Add a new job application, upload resume and cover letter.
3. View all applications in a dashboard.
4. Update status, add notes, set reminders.
5. Manage uploaded documents.
