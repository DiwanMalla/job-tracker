### 5. Configure Environment Variables
Go to your project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

Add these (for Production, Preview, Development):

```env
# Database (from step 3)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# NextAuth (generate secret below)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app

# Vercel Blob (from step 2)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_...
```

**Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 6. Run Database Migration
After adding environment variables:

**Option A: Via Vercel CLI**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Link project
vercel link

# Run migration
vercel env pull
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Option B: Add to package.json** (Already done!)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postbuild": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```
