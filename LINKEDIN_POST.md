‚Üí Easy sharing: Send read-only links to mentors/coaches
‚Üí Privacy controls: Your data, your rules

Built with: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Prisma, Vercel Blob, PostgreSQL

The entire project follows SOLID principles and is fully type-safe.

## Version 4: Technical Deep-Dive (For Developer Audience)

```
Deep dive into my latest Next.js 15 project üßµ

Built a job application tracker with some interesting technical decisions:

üèóÔ∏è Architecture:
‚Ä¢ Next.js 15 App Router with server components
‚Ä¢ Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
‚Ä¢ Vercel Blob for serverless file storage
‚Ä¢ Type-safe API routes with Zod validation

üîê Security:
‚Ä¢ NextAuth.js with credential provider
‚Ä¢ Bcrypt password hashing
‚Ä¢ Row-level security with user-scoped queries
‚Ä¢ File validation (type + size)
‚Ä¢ CSRF protection

üìÅ File Uploads:
‚Ä¢ Challenge: Vercel's serverless environment = no persistent storage
‚Ä¢ Solution: Vercel Blob for scalable object storage
‚Ä¢ Async uploads with progress indicators
‚Ä¢ Automatic cleanup on document replacement

üìä Features:
‚Ä¢ CRUD operations with optimistic updates
‚Ä¢ Real-time analytics dashboard
‚Ä¢ Shareable links with expiration
‚Ä¢ Document preview/download
‚Ä¢ Advanced filtering & sorting

The codebase follows SOLID principles with clean separation of concerns.
